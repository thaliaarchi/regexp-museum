# Oniguruma-To-ES

[[src](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es)]

JavaScript library by Steven Levithan to translate Oniguruma regular expression
patterns to ECMAScript 2018, 2024, or 2025.

Its parser is factored out as a library, [oniguruma-parser](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser),
which parses patterns to an AST and enables optimizing patterns.
