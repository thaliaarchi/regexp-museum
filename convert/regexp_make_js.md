# regexp-make-js

[[src](https://github.com/mikesamuel/regexp-make-js)]

A JavaScript library by Mike Samuel using ECMAScript 2015 template strings to
dynamically construct regular expressions. It can interpolate strings, numbers,
and regular expressions in atom, character class, and repetition count
positions. Interpolated strings are escaped and interpolations in character
classes match any character in the sub-expression.
