# Ken Thompson

Ken Thompson made a version of [QED](../editors/qed.md) for CTSS, [ed](../editors/ed.md),
and [grep](../greps/unix_grep.md).

From Mike Mahoney's [interview with Ken Thompson](https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/OralHistory/transcripts/thompson.htm)
on 1989-09-06:

Does this refer to his version of QED for CTSS or suggest earlier work on
regular expressions?
