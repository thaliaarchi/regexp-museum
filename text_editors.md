## Brief

Brief was first released in 1985. [texteditors.org](https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BriefFamily)
has useful info on Brief and clones and emulators of it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor))
has similar lists.

The changelog for [version 4.50](https://briefeditor.com/releases.htm)
states that it “Supports regular expression search and replace, both Brief and
Perl syntax”. It wouldn't make sense to invent a regexp syntax at the same
time as using Perl's, so I assume a version before 4.00 added Brief-syntax
regexps and is not listed. Only [Brief Professional](https://briefeditor.com/download.htm)
has “Find and replace using regular expressions”.
