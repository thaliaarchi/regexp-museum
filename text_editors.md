# Text editors

## Brief

Brief was first released in 1985. [texteditors.org](https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BriefFamily)
has useful info on Brief and clones and emulators of it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor))
has similar lists. It is closed-source.

The changelog for [version 4.50](https://briefeditor.com/releases.htm)
states that it “Supports regular expression search and replace, both Brief and
Perl syntax”. It wouldn't make sense to invent a regexp syntax at the same
time as using Perl's, so I assume a version before 4.00 added Brief-syntax
regexps and is not listed. Only [Brief Professional](https://briefeditor.com/download.htm)
has “Find and replace using regular expressions”.

## Zeus

[[site](https://www.zeusedit.com/index.html)]

Zeus has regexp search and replace, but [uses Unix-style](https://www.zeusedit.com/faq.html),
which is different from the original Brief. [Zeus Lite](https://www.zeusedit.com/lite/index.html)
still has search and replace with regexps. It is closed-source.

Versions:
- [Zeus 2.15](https://archive.org/details/ZEUSV215_ZIP) (exe and maybe source)
- [Zeus 3.30](https://archive.org/details/ze32v330_zip) (exe)
- [Zeus 3.99b](https://web.archive.org/web/20240427112542/https://www.zeusedit.com/z300/ze64v399b.zip)

- [Zeus 3.99b](https://web.archive.org/web/20240427112704/https://www.zeusedit.com/z300/ze32v399b.zip)
  (exe, 32-bit installer)
