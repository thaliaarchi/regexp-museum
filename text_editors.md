# Text editors

## Brief

Brief was first released in 1985. [texteditors.org](https://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BriefFamily)
has useful info on Brief and clones and emulators of it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor))
has similar lists. It is closed-source.

The changelog for [version 4.50](https://briefeditor.com/releases.htm)
states that it “Supports regular expression search and replace, both Brief and
Perl syntax”. It wouldn't make sense to invent a regexp syntax at the same
time as using Perl's, so I assume a version before 4.00 added Brief-syntax
regexps and is not listed. Only [Brief Professional](https://briefeditor.com/download.htm)
has “Find and replace using regular expressions”.

## ed

## Elvis

History: [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor))]

Elvis is an enhanced clone of vi. It has syntax highlighting, so should have
regular expressions.

## QED

## QEdit

## Zeus

[[site](https://www.zeusedit.com/index.html)]

Zeus has regexp search and replace, but [uses Unix-style](https://www.zeusedit.com/faq.html),
which is different from the original Brief. [Zeus Lite](https://www.zeusedit.com/lite/index.html)
still has search and replace with regexps.

Although is closed-source, the source for versions 1.04 and 2.15 is available.
CTAGS.C is taken from Elvis and changes to it are annotated.

URLs for old versions on zeusedit.com redirect to the latest. As such, I link to
IA for stability.

Selected [changelog](https://www.zeusedit.com/whatsnew.html):
> - Zeus IDE - Version 3.97p
>   - New 'debug regular expression' feature
> - Zeus IDE - Version 3.97a
>   - Regular expression engine subexpression limit increased from 9 to 19

As of [2012-07-29](https://www.zeusedit.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=9833#p9833),
the latest beta “now does 0-9 and A-Z sub expressions”.

## TODO

Investigate whether these editors contained regular expression engines. They are
likely dead ends, but are among many editor search results in the
[DEMU Collection Unsorted](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22DEMU+Collection+Unsorted%22+editor),
which is what Zeus is archived in.
