# Zeus

[[site](https://www.zeusedit.com/index.html)]

Zeus has regexp search and replace, but [uses Unix-style](https://www.zeusedit.com/faq.html),
which is different from the original Brief. [Zeus Lite](https://www.zeusedit.com/lite/index.html)
still has search and replace with regexps.

Although is closed-source, the source for versions 1.04 and 2.15 is available.
CTAGS.C is taken from Elvis and changes to it are annotated.

Zeus was called Zeus Programmers Editor in its early releases and is now called
Zeus IDE.
