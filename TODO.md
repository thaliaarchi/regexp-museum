## Exhibits

Extract every engine as a library and wrap each in a consistent C, Rust, and
WebAssembly API. Integrate them with Rebar.

Build an interactive demo, that allows you to convert between dialects using
InterRegexp and test expressions on text like Regexr, but executing the engines
locally via WebAssembly.
