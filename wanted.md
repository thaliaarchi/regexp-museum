    > Library. Included in this sub-subseries is a near-complete run of the
    > DECUS periodical titled *Copy-N-Mail*, printed from 1973 to 1980. Most of
    > this periodical’s editions focus on DECsystem-10 and DECsystem-20 models
    > of the PDP-10. The final issue of *Copy-N-Mail* identifies John Simon as
    > the editor. Other DECUS periodicals in this sub-subseries—with much fewer
    > editions—include *DECUSCOPE*, *DECUS magazine*, *Moby Munger* (the
    > official organ of DECUS’ TECO Special Interest Group), *DECUS Update*, and
    > *DECUS Journal*. Another large portion of this sub-subseries comprises
    > DECUS Program Library catalogs and software abstracts, along with forms
    > and correspondence relating to Litt’s borrowing and submitting programs to
    > the library. DECUS Program Library records in this sub-subseries include
    > both text and microfiche. Lastly, a DECUS membership guide is included
    > with this sub-subseries. These DECUS records are arranged alphabetically
    > by folder title.

    > This series is made up of material created by DECUS, the Digital Equipment
    > Corporation Users’ Society, from 1962 to 1993. Founded in 1961, DECUS was
    > a user group for individuals and companies who owned, worked on, or
    > programmed DEC computers. It was part of and subsidized by DEC, but run by
    > external volunteers. DECUS users shared software and knowledge with each
    > other, and DEC benefited by receiving product feedback from members. The
    > majority of material in this series consists of proceedings from DECUS
    > conferences in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan
    > dating from 1962 to 1990, with a mix of printed and microfilmed
    > proceedings. Starting in 1990, separate proceedings from each conference
    > were no longer published, and instead selected papers from each conference
    > and other technical papers were collected into one journal that was at
    > first called *International Proceedings of the Digital Equipment Computer
    > Users Society* and later *Transactions of the Digital Equipment Computer
    > Users Society*. This series contains issues from 1990 to 1992. There is
    > also a large number of issues of the *DECUS SIGs Newsletter*, which was a
    > monthly (later quarterly) collection of newsletters from different DECUS
    > U.S. chapter special interest groups. These date from 1986 to 1992. Also
    > included are issues of the DECUS member newsletter *DECUSCOPE* from 1962
    > to 1992, including issues in print and on microfilm and microfiche.
    > Finally, there is a DECUS annual report from 1990, program libraries from
    > the 1970s, and reports from DECUS U.S. DECsystem-10/20 meetings from 1977
    > to 1982. This series is arranged alphabetically by folder title.

Terms I have [searched](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/search/):
“sed” (4 results), “grep” (3 results), “regex” (0 results), “regexp” (0
results).

TODO: “regular expressions” (74 results), “decus”.

TODO: Search each of the 68 [finding aids](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/findingaids/).
For example, SuperGrep was found by the finding aid, not the catalog search.

TODO: They may have the DECUS Program Library.
