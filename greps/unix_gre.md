# Unix gre

A successor to [grep](unix_grep.md), [egrep](unix_egrep.md), and [fgrep](unix_fgrep.md),
which first appeared in Unix V10.

From its man page:

> <u>Gre</u> supplants three classic programs, which are still available:
>
> <u>Grep</u> handles only <u>ed</u>(1)-like regular expressions. It uses `\(\)`
> instead of `()`.
>
> <u>Egrep</u> handles the same patterns as gre except for back-referencing with
> `\1`, `\2`, ...
>
> <u>Fgrep</u> handles no operators except newline (alternation).
