# Ian Ashdown's fgrep

Author: Ian Ashdown (1984-1985)

An implementation of Unix fgrep using FSAs and the Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm.

As described by typist notes of Dominic Shields' copy:

> A full implementation of the UNIX 'fgrep'
> utility. The algorithm used in this program
> constructs a deterministic finite state automaton
> (FSA) for pattern matching from the substrings,
> then uses the FSA to process the text string in
> one pass. The time taken to construct the FSA is
> proportional to the sum of the lengths of the the
> substrings. The number of state transitions made
> by the FSA in processing the text string is
> independent of the number of substrings.
